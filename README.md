# gnlse-torch

**gnlse-torch** is a PyTorch-based implementation of the **(3+1)D Generalized Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation (GNLSE)** for simulating multimode nonlinear light propagation.  
It supports **GPU acceleration**, enables **gradient-based optimization** of nonlinear multimode dynamics, and provides tools for developing and training **surrogate models** for efficient approximations.


## Features
- (3+1)D GNLSE solver implemented in **PyTorch**  
- **GPU-accelerated** computation  
- **Gradient-based optimization** for multimode nonlinear propagation  
- **Surrogate modeling** support for data-driven optical simulations  
- Modular and extensible architecture  

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/myungjoon/gnlse-torch.git
